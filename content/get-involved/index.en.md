  Yes, Code for Romania is created and maintained by a volunteering team. And being part of this is totally worth it!

  However, maintaining the platform, the web domains and the hosting, attending certain events, some administrative stuff etc. – these imply some costs.

  If you think our work contributes to societal problems impacting you, you can also choose invest in us by donating. It allows us to invest our energy in things that truly matter: developing civic innovation projects and growing the community.

  You are facing lots challenges on a daily basis, from managing the volunteers’ activities to finding the best data-driven solution for the communities you serve. If you have a great idea but lack the resources, we are here to help.

  A very common misconception is that digital tools are unaffordable. For changing that, we support our civil society partners identify the solutions they need & help them implement.
