Our civic tech community works to solve meaningful challenges impacting communities. Here you can see all the Code for Romania projects, including the ones currently under development or already finished. "Code for" projects can range from mapping all first aid points in a city to creating a website which explains the law in lay terms or an app to facilitate the process of vote monitoring.
