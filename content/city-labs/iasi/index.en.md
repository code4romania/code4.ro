Welcome to Code for Iași, one of the most active Code for Romania City Labs, where developers, communications specialists, designers and data scientists build civic apps and programs meant to support the local community. 

If you want to find out more about our methodologies then read extra details about how we identify the community’s issues, how we conceive and prototype solutions in the Civic Lab and how they become reality through the Tech for Social Good programme. 

We work open source and open-heart. Whether you are a senior or a junior if you want to get involved and donate a few hours a week to a long-term, impactful project then we are happy to have you in our community. Do not forget, before you register using the link below, to read our Code of Conduct, to register in our local Facebook group and to participate in a local MeetUp.
