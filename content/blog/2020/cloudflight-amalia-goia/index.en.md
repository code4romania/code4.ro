For many of us, Code for Romania is more than another NGO or job, it is a cause. For others still, it is a lifestyle. With everything that it entails, Code for Romania’s projects become social clusters in themselves, where our volunteers socialize and learn new interesting things from one another. And we are rarely as happy as when people who know each other and work together choose to volunteer together, as well. Amalia is one such person. And together with her coworkers from Cloudflight, Amalia is one of the cornerstones of [Expert Consultation](https://civiclabs.ro/en/solutions/expert-consultation), one of our projects. So I sent Amalia an e-mail, asking her a few things about her experience as a Code for Romania volunteer.

1. <span class="has-text-success">**How long have you been volunteering with Code for Romania?**</span>  
  Since the summer of 2019.

2. <span class="has-text-success">**How did you hear of Code for Romania?**</span>  
  If I remember well, I saw a Facebook post about it and it sounded interesting, so I clicked on it.

3. <span class="has-text-success">**What made you want to be a part of Code for Romania?**</span>  
  First of all, to learn new things.

4. <span class="has-text-success">**What is the Code for Romania project that “keeps you up at night”? Why?**</span>  
  I am currently contributing to "Expert consultation".

5. <span class="has-text-success">**What was a challenge you faced in a Code for Romania project and how did you overcome it?**</span>  
  I had never worked with ngrx (state management for Angular) and I was not familiar with the whole concept either. I took it slowly, reading tutorials, asking people around about best practices, and then trying to implement something on my own.

6. <span class="has-text-success">**In what ways do you think Code for Romania can change our society for the better?**</span>  
  I think the digitalization of various things that are currently in use will save people time and reduce the frustration related to certain processes. It is also a good opportunity for whoever feels like "doing a tiny bit" for making the world (and Romania implicitly) a better place.

7. <span class="has-text-success">**What would you say to somebody to convince them to become a Code for Romania volunteer?**</span>  
  I would tell them that it's a good chance to learn and meet interesting people while making a contribution to "something bigger" than themselves.

8. <span class="has-text-success">**How does volunteering for Code for Romania help you personally?**</span>  
  By experimenting with new technologies/frameworks, by learning best practices from people wiser than me and by meeting cool people.

9. <span class="has-text-success">**Is there anybody in Code for Romania who you look up to, or consider a mentor or teacher? Why?**</span>  
  I think my fellow coworkers that are also contributing to Code4Ro on the same project as I am (George Bejan and Mihai Rinzis) are the ones from whom I learned the most during this time, so kudos to them for always sharing everything they find valuable and interesting and always being quick to help. :)
