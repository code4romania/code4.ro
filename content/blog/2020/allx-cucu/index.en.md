A hero of accessibility speaks about technology, administration and his life as a blind programmer in Romania.

One of the important directions for Code for Romania since its inception was the accessibility of digital products. When we talk about digitalization or the power of technology to solve society's problems we try to talk about the whole society. That's why the Code for Romania technological products are ready for accessibility and we aim to have our sites translated not only into Romanian and English but also into Hungarian and Romani.

But accessibility means more than just [alternative text](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/) for photos. Accessibility means a direct effort to be inclusive at all levels of society. And if you want to write about accessibility and technology, there is no better person to talk to than Allx Cucu.

[Allx](https://www.facebook.com/allxcucu) (as you will find him on Facebook) is a rockstar, and not just because he looks like the cool friend you used to go with to the metal rock bar in college. Developer, public speaker, accessibility NGO worker, player in the national football team for the blind (qualified in the European Championship!) Alex is a 100% Romanian success story and an example of the equalizing power of technology. I heard Allx speak for the first time at one of the Code for Romania [Hack Days](https://tfsg.code4.ro/en/hackday/) where he talked to us relaxed and humorous about accessibility and inclusivity as intrinsic values ​​in working with code. I wrote to him and invited him to tell me something about him, about his background and his vision about technology and accessibility.

As usual, the place where we saw each other was at the guest's discretion and on the occasion of this interview I entered, on a cold December day, for the first time after almost a year, the Old Center. I met Allx in front of the University and walked together through the maze of curbs, potholes and cars parked on the sidewalk to Oktoberfest for sausages and beer. It was a little hard for me to adjust to the ease with which Allx navigates obstacles in the city. With one hand on my shoulder he seemed super familiar with the situation, a situation that was stressing me out, especially as I was close a few times to breaking my neck in the potholes of the Capital. I ask him about this superpower that leaves me puzzled.

Allx tells me with a smile, "It comes from my background, from my childhood, when I had to remember potholes or bumps in the countryside."

Because Allx was born in the countryside, which makes his educational journey all the more fascinating. Born into a family in which his older brother was already blind, Allx had a penchant for technology as a child.

"I had a penchant for the exact sciences as a child, I had learned, for example, the multiplication table in first grade. Or, another example, I was disassembling radios - I still have a memory - I had climbed a mound of sand with my father's radio opened and I said I made a helicopter."

There is no explanation for the fact that both Cucu brothers were born blind, Allx speaks of Chernobyl radiation or genetic reasons as the most plausible reasons, but it is certain that, born into a typical family (the term used by Allx ) but with an older brother who was also blind, Allx had a free childhood, with parents who let both brothers do what they wanted without being overprotective.

„I can say that I have the tibiae more crooked after a free childhood but I am much more independent," says Allx, laughing.

We avoid a new round of crooked tibias, eventually arriving in an unpleasant rain in Oktoberfest Pub, a place where I had never been before but who always seems to be like home. We sit down at a table and carry on. I ask Allx what the rural school was like as a blind person.

He learned to read [în Braille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille) from his older brother and went through school without extra help.

"I didn't get help in general, just the help that I requested, like, I was leaving sports class to go to math class since class B, because I liked the teacher. He was satisfied that he had another person interested in his class and I was learning more and (I was still a teenager) I liked that I understood and I was appreciated for that. I was more rebellious then. For example, for teachers I didn’t like, I studied a lot and then I was late for classes on purpose so that they examine me and I get a high grade. Eventually I became friends with those teachers as well.”

In the sixth grade Allx received his first computer with speech synthesis, which could read what was happening on the screen. But the vocal synthesis was in English and he didn't know English, but it was still an essential instrument. He learned to type, like all of us, thanks to Yahoo Messenger.

"In Romania we need technology, especially for the blind. We need subsidies for assistive technology, socially offered devices. And we don't need 5,000-euro devices, but basic things like laptops, which can change the life of a blind person living in the rural area. If you do not have access to technology in rural areas, you have nothing to do. You sit and listen to the radio and TV all day instead of being productive and the family makes money from your social welfare. You can now be a functional member. Thirty years ago, if a blind person wanted to read an article, for example, someone had to read it to him or the article needed to be in Braille - **today blind people can do it in real time - technology equalizes, that's why it is needed**."

We order drinks and food. I, more of a hipster, order an IPA beer and a hot dog while Allx chooses beer sausages and mulled wine.

After school, Allx took the national exams (with the help of an interpreter) and although the grades allowed him access to almost any high school, he chose a high school for the blind, more for the blind community. That meant moving from Dâmbovița to Bucharest, to the dorm, and living alone at the age when most of us were still doing our birthdays at McDonalds.

“The high school education level was not aimed towards what I needed in high school - the way education was done for example. I was expecting inclusive education but it wasn't inclusive enough. Part of the problem was that I was the only one in the class who was completely blind, the rest were visually impaired and they were doing well. But I needed additional explanations but it was explained to me, because I was hardworking. The class master was a blind math teacher, but I didn't have him in class, so he tried to explain things to me outside of class. In any case, I was the only one in the class who went to college. The rest, most of them, went to become massage therapists, the most common job for the blind."

The food arrives and we start to devour our respective sausages. For a beer bar with cheap food Oktoberfest has some surprisingly good sausages. I ask Allx about the decision to go to college in computer science. He smiles at me.

"In high school I had a great dilemma. I knew I wanted to go to college but I didn't know what specialization. I was passionate about IT but also law. I read a lot Mihail Drumeș - The Magheru Case, Student Dima from the seventh grade and I was thinking about law because I wanted to help people. But I decided that computer science was a better way to secure my income in the future, and in addition, I could help people with that specialization as well. For example, in high school I ruined the gig for some boys who demanded money from colleagues to install Windows and screen reading programs. I was annoyed when a colleague told me that they had asked him for 50 lei to install the program and then another ten lei surcharge to set it to his favorite voice. So I learned to do this myself and then I taught others for free. And that's when I decided I wanted to do something about assistive technology. "

We stop for a while, have a drink and go outside for a while. It's Thursday, but there's already a Friday vibe outside, because of the holidays. Allx listens to his messages on the phone and I ask him a few questions about assistive technology. Apple products have been pioneers of speech synthesis since the first iPod Nano, in 2002 they were completely accessible to the blind. Today, iPhone is one of the most accessible devices, which is why they have apparently sold over a million units to the blind. Android also has accessibility features but they are not as developed or intuitive as on the iPhone. I tell Allx that I find it funny how much the situation is similar to the one for typical people, for whom the iPhone is also the simplest and most intuitive phone. We return insinde, where Allx also shows me his "field" laptop used more as a kind of remote terminal for the screen-reader at home. "It's very weak but I use it almost as a kind of portable keyboard." Smile. "I took it from Resealed, with the money I made from football." I always thought that programmers were not good at sports, but here is Allx, trying real hard to destroy all my preconceptions.

We return to his academic career and Allx becomes a little nostalgic.

"July 15, 2013 is one of my glory days. I was admitted to the Math-IT faculty without an exam. I had a national Olympic diploma for the math Olympiad but I didn't know if they would accept it, because it was from a special school. But the dean and the secretary saw a copy and said it was okay. And that's how I got to the Faculty of Math-IT. ”

"In the Faculty I was lucky with people. The class colleagues were open, they didn't know how to behave around me, but they were, most of them, inclusive. They also helped me with the courses, which they dictated to me in a format accessible to me. I also had difficulties with the materials, until the teacher gave me access to the LaTex code from which they generated the pdfs. I went to the teachers and explained in detail the problems where I could not draw or explain graphically. In the whole faculty I had only one teacher who asked me for a paper from the management to let me take the exam on my laptop, but the dean said that there was no problem.

After college, Allx began organizing a series of meetups between the typical and the blind, to share experiences. That's how he found out about the existence of [AMAis](http://www.amais.ro/). Initially an NGO made by architects trying to bring closer the typical and the blind, AMAis quickly became one of the most active NGOs in this field. From meetings that explained architecture for the blind to various common courses for them and typicals, AMAis was exactly what Allx was looking for.

"Since 2015 I am in AMAis but only since 2017 I am super active in it. I never wanted to be a classic NGO worker - I want to work something else and help, but not to make a goal out of working for an NGO. That's why I work part time to support myself, and I devote the rest of my time to AMAis. If I start calculating the number of hours at AMAis, I might reach full time there, also. But yes, I have a lot of moments when I don't know if I am working or not, because the people from AMAis became my friends and my friends joined AMAis. ”

AMAis also deals with a series of programs that bring together typical people with the blind in various workshops – blind cooking, pottery, even playing audio games, an absolutely fascinating topic. Allx also participates in a series of online programming courses aimed at the blind, courses taught by blind programmers.

“Three out of every five blind programmers in Romania are involved in this project, based on a curriculum developed by a colleague. The courses take place Wednesday on Skype. We have a number of students, some from the special high school others not, for example there is a kid from Oradea who never did any school of the blind - he learned to use the PC at home and now he is in high school with a Math-IT profile. Another kid who takes classes is an extremely good pianist, but he wants to also learn to program, to divide his life between piano and code. It is progressing very well, we now have children who make their own management applications for school, for example."

Besides AMAis, Allx works in a large company, where he has all the support needed for the job.

"Colleagues are super open, and we are friends outside work, we go out to eat or bowling together, for example. When it comes to work tasks, I know what kind of tasks I can do without problems."

Code for Romania has recently released a series of [7 public policy recommendations](https://code4.ro/ro/blog/7-politici-publice/) and one of them is the accessibility of government websites. Before leaving, I ask Allx what the situation is with the administration websites and what can be done to improve them.

"We need inclusive thinking. Whoever makes a site, for example, should always think about what kind of users might visit the site - to think of others. The law is not the problem, the law already says that sites must be accessible. But it's a disaster - for example the social2.ro site, owned by DGASPC sector 2, where I had to go for some documents. Or Gov.ro. But the worst thing is when you find out that there are facilitation elements, such as online programming, which are available for the typical but inaccessible."

What should the state do to make it more accessible?

"Uniformity. Equal treatment. To be able to schedule anything. And more things can stem from that - accessibility standards should become mainstream, standards that, again, are already legislated only that they are not respected. Basically to apply the laws of the state in the state institutions. "That's why the administration exists. And last but not least, make technology accessible to all, because technology equalises."

And Allx is perhaps the best example of the equalizing power of technology. Born in the countryside, an overachiever since childhood, Allx has become a banner bearer for the Romanian disabled community and an accessibility expert. All this may never have been possible without the power of technology to open up opportunities. Allx Cucu, a true Hero of Tech.
