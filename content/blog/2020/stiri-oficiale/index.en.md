## **[Stirioficiale.ro](https://stirioficiale.ro/informatii), the first site in the ecosystem of 6 digital solutions to combat the effects of COVID-19, was launched by the Code for Romania Task Force in partnership with the Romanian Government through the Authority for the Digitization of Romania and the Department for Emergency Situations.**

We live in an unprecedented global reality so accurate information is essential in order to reach a level of stabilization. A source of correct information, not fed by panic can help the Romanian population to be vigilant in the way they access, assimilate and distribute the bursts of news presented in the media.

[stirioficiale.ro](https://stirioficiale.ro/informatii) is a project carried out **pro-bono by Code for Romania volunteers, an independent non-governmental organization, apolitical and politically unaffiliated. The project is carried out within the Code for Romania Task Force in partnership with the Government of Romania through the Authority for the Digitization of Romania and the Department for Emergency Situations.**

The information published on stirioficiale.ro is the official source of information for the public and media representatives, developed in partnership with the Romanian Government through the Authority for the Digitization of Romania and refers to the ongoing situation caused by the spread of Coronavirus infection (COVID-19). **The știrioficiale.ro project is part of an ecosystem of six digital solutions developed by Code for Romania volunteers, meant to fight the effects of COVID-19. The ecosystem will function as a central information point about the situation in Romania and will be launched publicly in the coming days.**

**The browser extension “covid-19 știri oficiale”** identifies key phrases in any web page and adds an infobox over them that directs to the official sources of information. The extension can be installed on [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/covid-19-știri-oficiale/pdcpkplohipjhdfdchpmgekifmcdbnha) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/covid-19-știri-oficiale/) and complements the digital solution [stiroficiale.ro](http://stiroficiale.ro/). The concept is developed as part of the [Civic Labs program](https://civiclabs.ro/ro/domains/mediu) of Code for Romania.

## Code for Romania projects against the effects of COVID-19

The other digital solutions in the ecosystem developed by the Code for Romania Task Force in partnership with the Romanian Government through the Romanian Digitalization Agency to be launched in the next few days are:

- [stamacasa.ro](https://stamacasa.ro/) is a digital solution with which we reduce the load of emergency numbers, we quickly collect information from a very large population and thus facilitate a constant assessment of the situation, providing support in case management for authorities;

- [rohelp.ro](https://rohelp.ro/) is a digital solution with the help of which it will be possible to make a coherent and safe collection of aid, of any kind, by connecting the competent NGOs with the offer of resources made available.
- [cemafac.ro](https://cemafac.ro/) is the application through which you will be able to evaluate correctly and quickly the decisions you have to take as a result of the effects caused by COVID-19 in Romania, directly from official sources;

**In addition to the six identified solutions that are already under development and due to be launched this week, there are other solutions under analysis and prototyping that will effectively and strategically combat the effects of COVID-19.**
