On March 7, every year we celebrate Open Data Day, an important day in the Code for Romania office. Because access to [open data](https://civiclabs.ro/ro/domains/date-deschise), part of the [Transparency](https://civiclabs.ro/ro/domains/transparenta) report from Civic Labs, and one of the [seven public proposals for the digitization of Romania]https://code4.ro/ro/blog/7-politici-publice/, is one of the most important objectives of our organization, and not just because we work with them every day. Open data can bring significant economic benefits, improve social research and lead to innovations and real leaps forward in society. In Timisoara, for example, it took a single stream of open data on public transport for a suite of free transportation applications to appear that made life easier for Timisoara residents. Because we trust open data and in order to stimulate this kind of small changes with major impact, from March 7 we want to talk to you about [Data Portal](https://civiclabs.ro/ro/solutions/data-portal).

Data Portal is an open data platform that hosts and serves, through API, data sets, configured to European data opening standards, integrated with a data visualization system ([Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/)) that will increase the accessibility of citizens to information and will serve as a basis for decisions made at the local level in both public and private or non-profit. Code for Romania ensures, with the help of kind volunteers, the development of the platform, its integration with existing systems in public institutions and the automation (where possible) of the collection of data of public interest at the level of each town hall. The solution is designed to provide a turnkey data portal for any institution that is interested, its installation and configuration being only a matter of hours.

Why all this?  
We live in the “big data” era, in which data sets, in the right hands, can change a community, a city or, why not, a country. [The Data Portal project](https://civiclabs.ro/ro/solutions/data-portal) wants to make this easy and stimulate the growth of a community around the idea of ​​a high standard data hub, an idea that can be scaled both down, locally, where we already have three pilot partnerships, and up, at international level.
In addition, Code for Romania is not only programmers. Among the people who volunteer within the organization we have a "core" of sociologists, statisticians and data scientists from academia, members of civil society or business environment, local entrepreneurs, with which we build strategies and align our projects for the future. Invariably, among the people who work with data there is a consensus that Romania is deficient in terms of public data - remember for example that 2014 is the last year in which the Ministry of Environment, Water and Forests uploaded data sets to the national portal or that we have over 7.7 million wealth declarations that are not digitized so no real correlations or analyzes can be made based on them. Not only is the vast majority of data not open, but publicly accessible data is often of poor quality, with polluted, coarse data sets, full of incomplete entries, formatting errors, or graphs that are poorly constructed or not harmonized with other data sets. All this means that it is extremely difficult to work with the data sets that can be accessed at this time in Romania and that, most of the time, you have to invest a lot of time and resources in bringing that data to a minimum usable standard.

From our point of view, Romania does not currently have an open data portal designed for the public or for third parties. Existing data portals are not designed for ease of use or reading and are usually compact data sets uploaded "because they have to be". Equally, the data present in the few existing databases do not meet some basic criteria of "cleanliness" and data structure that would make them much more useful in research. And it is here that our project, [Data Portal](https://civiclabs.ro/ro/solutions/data-portal), comes into play, with its two components: at the local level, the **Data Portals of the three (for now) pilot cities** to be launched soon (Timisoara, Cluj and Iasi) that will centralize public data and, with the help of the local university community, will create standardized data sets that can be used by data scientists, sociologists, journalists and statisticians to extract useful information for a more informed Romania. **The national Data Portal managed by Code for Romania** will centralize open data from civil society (it will also include the data sets that Code for Romania holds), from the private sector and other areas with valuable data that cannot be put on the data portal of the Government. The Data Portal volunteer team will organize all data sets according to the same structure as in the case of Local Portals, so that the sets are compatible with each other and allow an analysis on all levels.

We want the Data Portal project to become a basic project for the development of a robust Open Data community in Romania. We believe that it is the perfect technological tool through which we will make our data infrastructure and know-how available to volunteers interested in [“opening” and “cleaning”](https://civiclabs.ro/ro/solutions/data-scientists-hub) public data in Romania but also in society as a whole.

_I take this opportunity to invite to discussions about Open Data and the Data Portal solution developed by Code for Romania both those who have data and want to make them available to the public and city representatives who want transparency in their relationship with its citizens._
