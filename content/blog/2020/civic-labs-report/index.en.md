<span class="has-background-warning">The first year of study of the [Civic Labs program](https://civiclabs.ro/ro/domains)</span> developed by Code for Romania <span class="has-background-warning">is over and will present its conclusions weekly</span> for each of the six areas studied, <span class="has-background-warning">[starting with February 25](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/code-for-romania-29453407669)</span>.

After sitting at the table with all relevant actors and identifying the most important focal points for the six areas of study (Health, Education, Environment, Civic Involvement, Vulnerable Groups and Transparency) **we then built the most effective digital solutions to address them or solve them completely. We have thus identified over 70 digital solutions that we invite you to discover with us during six weekly meetings:**:

- February 25 - [Transparency // Open data & Access to legislation](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/transparenta-date-deschise-acces-la-legislatie-civic-labs-an-1-tickets-92698877839);

**Places for each debate are limited** so please book a place <span class="has-background-warning">[here](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/code-for-romania-29453407669)</span> as soon as possible.

<span class="has-background-warning">On the occasion of each event, the new study subdomain for 2020 from **[Civic Labs](https://civiclabs.ro/ro/domains)** will be launched.</span>

The mechanism of operation of Civic Labs involves, after the research and identification of solutions, transferring them for implementation and administration to NGOs and identifying funders to make this possible for them. **The event is thus intended equally for members of civil society, the business environment, the authorities, the media and the general public and is free**.

We thank the strategic partners of Civic Labs without whom the project could not have taken place in 2019 such as the Vodafone Romania Foundation and Lidl Romania, our domain sponsors such as Avon and those who will continue with us in 2020, such as Lidl Romania or who have chosen to support some of the most important domains, such as the Vodafone Romania Foundation.
