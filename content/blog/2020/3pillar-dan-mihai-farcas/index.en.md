Code for Romania means more than our programs and the applications we produce for society. Before anything, Code for Romania is defined by our volunteers, volunteers who dedicate their time to making Romania the country we all want. And when these volunteers are part of our sponsor communities, we are even happier. Let's meet **Dan Mihai Farcas**, from **3PillarGlobal**, dedicated coder, Code for Romania volunteer on the [Seismic Risk project](https://github.com/code4romania/seismic-risc) and <span class="has-background-warning">#Herooftech.</span>

1. <span class="has-text-success">**Why Code for Romania? What is different about our volunteer community?**</span>  
   Code for Romania is unique in the Romanian society for the fact that it manages to gather over 1000 talented IT volunteers, in order to build applications for the benefit of society.

2. <span class="has-text-success">**What is your background in the field? How did you get to 3Pillar?**</span>  
   I started with BASIC as a child, I learned the scripting language from mIRC and Linux, during the period when Internet Cafes were in vogue, in the late 90's and early 2000. I worked at two more companies until I reached 3Pillar. I got here because I heard a lot of good things about the company. After some discussion about the way people work here, I joined the team. Two years later, I'm happy with the decision.

3. <span class="has-text-success">**Why did you choose the Code project you are working on now?**</span>  
   It's a Django + React project. It's an interesting stack.

4. <span class="has-text-success">**What are your favorite projects from Code?**</span>  
   I really liked how ‘Rezultate Vot’ evolved, because it started from a simple idea that became very popular nationally. Another project in which I see value is ‘Monitorizare Vot’, due to the fact that it is a tool used by NGOs to signal voting irregularities, an application with increased complexity, completed.

5. <span class="has-text-success">**If you could "adopt" a project, on which only you would work, what would that project be?**</span>  
   I don't know if I would take over a whole project - collaboration is one of the most important things in Tech For Social Good and that makes things work so well.

6. <span class="has-text-success">**Why are open data important?**</span>  
   Open data is important for the general public and for private companies. Open data gives citizens the opportunity to innovate new and useful applications.

7. <span class="has-text-success">**How do your colleagues react when you tell them that you are volunteering in your free time?**</span>  
   In almost all cases, they are also interested in getting involved, due to the fact that it is a good opportunity to write open-source code, to know and collaborate with talented people.

8. <span class="has-text-success">**If you could digitize one thing in Romanian society, what would that be?**</span>  
   I think that an extremely complex problem with an urgent need for digitization would be in the field of infrastructure in health services.

9. <span class="has-text-success">**What is your take on the local Code for Romania community? What would you like to improve?**</span>  
   At the Hack Days in Cluj I was always pleasantly surprised by the large number of participating volunteers. The locations, coffee and pizza have always been good. On the organizational side, things have improved considerably in the last year.

10. <span class="has-text-success">**What do you like about Code for Romania?**</span>  
    I appreciate the value it brings to society, the Hack Days and the conversations on Slack.

11. <span class="has-text-success">** What do you like about 3Pillar?**</span>  
    The main things I appreciate about 3Pillar are the organizational culture, the way the teams are structured and the talent that this company attracts. The fact that this company has unlimited Work From Home is a beautiful privilege.

12. <span class="has-text-success">**What improvements would you bring to Code for Romania?**</span>  
    There is room for development on the topic of toolkits. Due to the fact that a large part of the code is written in the monthly Hackathons, at least on the Front-End side, the development time of the projects would be drastically reduced. In exchange for an initial investment of time, you could create application templates (for example, create-react-app customized for Code for Romania) and custom element templates on the look-and-feel of Code for Romania projects. Also, a global code style guide on all projects would be a good standard.
