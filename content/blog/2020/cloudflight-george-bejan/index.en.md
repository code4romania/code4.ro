Here at Code for Romania, we are at our happiest when our sponsors and our diligent volunteers meet. Sponsors get a chance to know the people working to make Romania into a better place and volunteers get to see the companies that put their money where their mouth is, backing their efforts in digitizing the country. And what can be better than when volunteers come from our sponsors’ teams? George Bejan is one of these super-volunteers because he works for Cloudflight and Cloudflight is one of Tech for Social Good’s strategic sponsors. So I asked George a few questions about Code for Romania and he was kind enough to answer them by mail. Thank you, George, and thank you Cloudflight!

1. <span class="has-text-success">**How long have you been volunteering with Code for Romania?**</span>  
  I have volunteered with Code for Romania since the summer of 2018.

2. <span class="has-text-success">**How did you hear of Code for Romania?**</span>  
  During an election day, a volunteer from Code for Romania developed a website to view the voting data in a simple manner. This website was shared by EuropaFM and got on my Facebook wall. After I saw that this was part of the Code for Romania organization, I started to look for information about the organization and found out that there are a whole lot more projects going on.

3. <span class="has-text-success">**What made you want to be a part of Code for Romania?**</span>  
  I decided to join Code for Romania because I liked the mission statement and wanted to use my skills in order to advance that mission as much as I could.

4. <span class="has-text-success">**What is the Code for Romania project that “keeps you up at night”? Why?**</span>  
  [Expert Consultation](https://civiclabs.ro/en/solutions/expert-consultation). Expert Consultation is a project designed to ease the process of public consultation with experts in Romania. At first, I joined the project because it is built with a familiar tech stack (Spring Boot  + Angular) and I stayed because I like the idea and the group that was built around the project.

5. <span class="has-text-success">**What was a challenge you faced in a Code for Romania project and how did you overcome it?**</span>  
  Since the projects that we work on are open-source and people with different backgrounds work on them, sometimes it is difficult to keep a consistent way of doing things in the project. We try to solve this by carefully reviewing each pull request and leaving appropriate comments. 

6. <span class="has-text-success">**In what ways do you think Code for Romania can change our society for the better?**</span>  
  Technology has disrupted so many fields and has become an integral part of our lives. Code for Romania is using technology in order to improve bits and pieces of our society. From saving time to more open access to public data these projects will improve the everyday life of the users.

7. <span class="has-text-success">**What would you say to somebody to convince them to become a Code for Romania volunteer?**</span>  
  Instead of complaining about different lacks in our public society, better join Code for Romania and use your skills to improve its project by project.

8. <span class="has-text-success">**How does volunteering for Code for Romania help you personally?**</span>  
  I get to do what I like and meet interesting people along the way.

9. <span class="has-text-success">**Is there anybody in Code for Romania who you look up to, or consider a mentor or teacher? Why?**</span>  
  Not a single person, but all the colleagues that I work with. I learn something new or different from each pull request or discussion that we have.

10. <span class="has-text-success">**What would you say to yourself about Code for Romania, 30 years from now?**</span>  
  In 30 years I hope to be able to tell myself that Code for Romania has played an important role in the digitization process in Romania.
