For almost two years now, Code for Romania has been growing due to the immense work put in by our volunteers. Amazing minds coming together and delivering digital solutions meant to solve societal problems. Experts, specialists, academics, developers, Romanians living home or abroad have gathered around a single common goal: to make home a better place to live in. It is thanks to them that today we have a functioning 500+ volunteers organisation and we wish to celebrate their efforts by inviting you to meet them individually and see for yourself how great they are.

Having Mihai around feels like having a bigger brother always taking care of you. He is probably the chillest person you could meet in your life and most definitely an excellent beer companion. But he is more than that. [Mihai][1] has over 10 years of experience working in enterprise IT, with a background focusing on network and information security. He has graduated with an InfoSec master’s degree from Military Technical Academy and holds a large variety of industry certifications. His eyes light up every time you bring in disruptive technologies and the impact they have on our daily life in the conversation. Today he lives in London and dedicates most of his evenings to teach us how to stay safe online and making sure our apps are always above standars from an IT security point of view.

We take advantage of this blog post to also tell you that soon you will hear about Incognito, a project very dear to Mihai, that he coordinated head to heels. It’s obviously a security jewel and it will come in handy very soon for many people.

We asked Mihai to give us a set of keywords describing his skills, and the list ranges from IT security, training, solution architecture up to enterprise IT governance and procrastination (indeed, it took a while to send us this list, Mihai).

>"I joined Code4 knowing that IT can impact people’s lives in a positive manner and Romania has a lot to catch to reach its true potential. The team at Code4 is full of positive energy and it is one of the most forward-thinking non-profits I have ever seen," says Mihai about his motivation to join Code for Romania.

He believes that in IT it’s really hard to separate work from passion — so he still has geeky hobbies like reading about security topics, working on his own IoT projects or trying to identify new ways technology can help businesses and people. Mihai also likes outdoor activities (especially if it involves cycling), good food and beers. Judging by all the pictures he has next to his lovely German shepard, we could definitely say he is a dog person, so just in case you ever wonder what to give him for his birthday, go for dog toys and gadgets.
