It would be a bit exaggerated to say that Alin Zăinescu invented digital marketing in Romania. But I will do it anyway. Because Alin brought in concepts like pay-per-acquisition in domestic marketing, he transformed Yahoo Messenger into a [marketing tool](https://www.iqads.ro/articol/10627/s-a-lansat-status-pimp-retea-de-publicitate-prin-statusuri-de-im) and built the first e-learning platform in Romania. Alin has been everything from journalist to teacher to publicist to serial entrepreneur. Today he is a father and a volunteer for Code for Romania and prepares his next business idea from overseas, from New York.

I met Alin at the [corner of Central Park on 5th Avenue](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pulitzer+Fountain/@40.7640234,-73.9736233,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xc4a274a5861989fa?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjX3Mv544jlAhVBb1AKHWcFB04Q_BIwF3oECAoQCA) on a sunny October day. On the bank next to me two business-bros were eating hot dogs. On the alley, a girl does pirouettes then continues along, dancing like she’s in Swan Lake, with the earphones in her ears. A normal day in New York.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„We have to get away from here, from the tourists," Alin tells me when we finally cross at the Grand Army Plaza. We cross the street near the Trump Tower and walk a few streets further away from the crowds of tourists gravitating toward the Apple Store on 5th Ave.</p>

Alin recently returned to New York after spending more time on the west coast. It's a big change. New York is oppressive, big and full of known people. On the west coast, he had a swimming pool in the yard, a river behind the house and could ride everywhere, in New York everything is pedestrian or dependent on the subway. Alin now exercises by taking his daughter to and from school. Why move away from the warm weather then, „[nice and sunny everyday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeSL2HUTdFk)” as a classic comic said. California is a great place, but even with all the pools and the continuous heat, it's far from home. But New York is home to Alin who lived here for years. So I'm asking him to take me to one of his favorite places in New York and we continue talking on the way there.

Alin says, more or less in jest, that he was a "small businessman". As he started high school right as the communism was falling, he took advantage of the new freedom to make the school magazine, using a second-hand typewriter brought by a relative from abroad and a copier he had access to through his parents. The 20-30 copies of the paper were selling like hot bread. As he got to college, Alin was quickly back behind a typewriter, this time in the free press of the 1990s. Although he was a reporter on politics and nobody paid him for discretionary effort, he took advantage of his journalist identity as to write about culture. This is how he got into films, plays and various parties and cultural happenings. Then he changed the print media to the radio, where he was a news editor. He applied this press experience a few years later when he got to do political PR at a time when people didn't know much about PR or politics in Romania. He didn’t stay long in the field - after the mid-90s, with an increasingly professional advertising market, Alin got to do real PR.

The experience in advertising and PR shows when Alin confidently “sells” me the place he has chosen. [The Ear Inn](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ear+Inn/@40.7236174,-74.008753,16.86z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c259f309c528b5:0x87a3783a4b8a6f31!8m2!3d40.725844!4d-74.0094933) is a historic bar that claims to be the oldest in New York. Located in Hudson Square, a mini-neighborhood caught between SoHo shopping and Tribeca show-offs, The Ear Inn doesn't see too many tourists. This is what Zăinescu recommends about it, adding that the place is so cool that "I came here with my daughter." The place is fantastic, a British pub with a week-end working-class New York vibe. Locals, authentic and noisy New Yorkers create the atmosphere. The tables are covered with paper and you have crayons on each table in case you are ten years old or you get inspiration. The menu offers classic burgers, dumplings but also mussels with wine sauce. They have [their own beer](https://untappd.com/b/ear-inn-ear-inn-ale/612859), made in the heart of the hipster movement, in Williamsburg, by [Brooklyn Brewery](https://brooklynbrewery.com/about/about-the-brewery), one of my favorite breweries. Alin chose well.

Although he has not been to The Ear for several years, Alin talks to staff as if he were there every evening. You can clearly see his experience in advertising but also the ease of the professional teacher. That’s because Alin has taught for many years in the Faculty of Communication and Public Relations in Bucharest. He is very proud of that period, not only because half of the people who work in Digital today were his students and greet him at concerts with "mister teacher" even though he flunked them, but also because he managed to bring [Wally Ollins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_Olins) in Romania or because he managed, on European funds, to found the faculty publishing house and make it cool.

In the early 2000's Alin took another shot as an entrepreneur. He started with a small PR agency, with a website that aggregated press releases and with tech clients. In a few years he had no time for PR anymore, because he dominated the digital market and juggled campaigns for several banks at the same time. He sold everything just before 2008 and went all-in in entrepreneurship by becoming angel investor for a number of digital projects.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„We made all the businesses because we saw needs. A need found from friends or from the market - a need, that's all you need for a good business” Alin tells me as we both eat real burgers in one of the most real places in the world that I've ever been in.</p>

This year, while still in California, Alin was instrumental in organizing our first international Hack Day at GitHub Headquarters in San Francisco. Why the love affair with Code, I ask.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„Eh, I hope we are only at the beginning of a love story" Alin Zăinescu tells me as I start to decorate the table with crayons.</p>

    <p class="is-italic">„I like to give something back, to make connections with people, to help them discover new and cool things.”</p>

</blockquote>

Alin left Romania, he also left California but something ties him to both of them.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">"I have half a family in Romania and I always look for a reason to return, I want to use my skills in a new field, the NGO one, because it seems to me that I can bring a lot of new know-how from here, from America, there are many useful things not used in Romania, especially on the funding side - the field is not yet professionalized. That's why I document myself, that's why I try to learn.”</p>

    <p class="is-italic">„I often feel like an imposter in this field (ed. note - fundraising), just like I felt in digital for a long time," says the man who practically invented digital in Romania, while we’re having another round of beers.</p>

</blockquote>

{{< figure src="alin-interview-6.jpg" >}}

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„I feel between two worlds, here I have my family, while the past and my friends tie me to Romania.”</p>
</blockquote>

What about California?

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„It's ... it's better in New York, or even in Bucharest," Alin tells me, laughing. "I hope you’re not writing this down," he tells me, as I am writing it all down.</p>
</blockquote>

What can we do better at Code for Romania? I ask, as I finish drawing my masterpiece on the table.

{{< figure src="alin-interview-7.jpg" >}}

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„We should not be ashamed to be more daring. Let's show that we can, brand our headquarters, products, show that we can. We must not be humble, but neither should we buy a Rolls Royce." (damn, I canceled the order).</p>

    <p class="is-italic">„Regarding the diaspora, we need to get out of the tech area. Let's talk to all the Romanians in the diaspora who are interested in us. And not just in America. Not just in the diaspora actually. We need to build bridges for donors and volunteers who can do other things. Because there are people from many areas who want to get involved.”</p>

    <p class="is-italic">„Look - especially with Civic Labs, we have some direct results, clear directions - the people who get involved want to see that they have a direct impact, that if they helped, either with money or work, something happened.”</p>

</blockquote>

Alin is right. And, between the GitHub commits after each Hack Day and the by-products of each season in Civic Labs, that's what we're trying to do. We thank the volunteers and [donors](https://code4.ro/ro/doneaza/) by showing that everything they do is transcribed into a directly measurable impact, an impact that means a flow of good. At the strategic level, Alin read us like an open book.

We left the Ear after Alin renewed his friendship with the bartender he hadn't seen in years. It is already almost evening, but it is a pleasant early October evening, sunny, with the light filtering through the Manhattan blocks. I take a cover photo of Alin for a text that I already know will be too long.

Alin Zăinescu is in New York - family father, marketing pioneer and serial entrepreneur, preparing for the next chapter of his life. Fortunately for all of us in the community, that new chapter seems to include lots of Code for Romania.
