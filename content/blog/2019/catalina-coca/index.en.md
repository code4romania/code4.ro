You wouldn't be able to guess Cătălina Coca’s age the first time you see her. For more than a year of working together at Code for Romania, I was convinced that she was at most 25 years old. I was surprised to find that we are the same age, she’s even a few months older than me. We even went to the same college. I went out for tea with Cătălina on a rainy day to find out more about her and everything that drives her.

What I want to mention that the place we went to was the choice of Cătălina. [Bohemia Tea House](http://bohemiatea.ro/), located across from the Conservatory, near the institute where we both took college classes. The place is extremely Hygge, the kind of relaxing place, lit only with soft and warm light. There are no chairs, everyone sits on some kind of dubious beanbags on the floor while the background music is muffled. It is not the most comfortable place for me but it is extremely relaxing.

We order hot chocolate and tea and I ask Cătălina, - Cocuța for friends - where she is from. She tells me that she was born in Oltenia, and she grew up in the countryside with her grandparents until school age. Then she moved to Târgoviște where her parents were assigned.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„I was a single kid, but I always wanted to have brothers. I kept telling my parents that I wanted seven brothers, that they had to get brothers from somewhere. It couldn't be done, so I said I wanted a puppy, but that wasn't possible either, because I was living in a three-room apartment building. But it was hard for me, because before that I grew up surrounded by animals in the countryside.”</p>
</blockquote>

Cătălina went to school in Târgoviște from kindergarten until she finished high school. In high school she was a cheerleader, a DJ on recess - a position she fought for - and a Junior Prom queen.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„I have always been very active. But at that time I was braver, I was younger - I wasn't afraid to talk. In primary school I was in the school fire team - responsible for the evacuation - I had learned to throw the hose and use it to extinguish fires. I was also in the Red Cross.”</p>
</blockquote>

Cătălina went to high school in humanities because that attracted her. However, she always knew that her parents wanted her to become an engineer. But more than that, they wanted to see her happy.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„The house was full of math books kept by my father for me. But more important to him was for me to do what I want. And, for example, I didn't want classic college classes, because they had an outdated teaching system. That's why I was attracted to the FSP admission system.”</p>
</blockquote>

This is also what i liked at the Faculty of Political Sciences (FSP) at the University, the fact that one is admitted on the basis of essays, essays based on books of political theory or philosophy. Cătălina and I did the same section, English, but we never crossed path then, although there was a difference of only one year of study between us.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„After organizing the Junior Prom in high school, I enjoyed college very much because classes were based on debates. In addition, I was able to continue participating in various activities close to my soul. I, for example, enjoy taking photos, a childhood passion, since my dad had a small photo developing studio at home, in the bathroom - I always considered it to be the most beautiful way to keep memories. ”</p>
</blockquote>

Cătălina cannot stand still. She doesn't know if it's FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) or just her way of being, but she always wants to do things. Take pictures. Dance. She would like to write a book.

Like many political science graduates, she doesn't work in this field, but she doesn't mind.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„I liked to write and my first jobs were related to writing. I worked for a business women magazine. I was writing about cars, I was doing drive tests.”</p>

    <p class="is-italic">„You did what?”</p>

</blockquote>

I couldn't help myself here and asked her in shock what her favorite car was.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„I prefer Italian cars. They are more feminine and more agile”, Coca answers me, smiling at my mansplainer trick question. "But I drove a lot of cars anyway. The prettiest, Mini Cooper S. The most expensive I think was a hybrid Lexus. Anyway, I was also reviewing them from a female perspective - space, design, things like that. I was also on the jury that chose the car of the year.”</p>
</blockquote>

All this was happening while Cătălina was doing her master's degree. After the master she moved to interior design. And that's how she got to know two of our common colleagues today.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„I joined the Romania Liberă trust in the Interior Design division. Cătălin was at that time chief of the entire online division, and Olivia came in as our new colleague. I love teamwork and I was just dying for a colleague, so I drew a small house for her first day in the newsroom. When Olivia came in, dressed in black, serious, I was scared. But it was very good because, although I was in antithesis with Olivia on colors, we complemented each other at work. Code for Romania is the fourth project we are working on together.”</p>
</blockquote>

Today, when she's not at the wheel of social media accounts at Code for Romania, Cătălina works at IBM, a long way from her past in the press and in agencies.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„I work on internal jobs, I do content for campaigns, I help create pipelines and so on. It's very different from what I was doing until now.”</p>
</blockquote>

Speaking of different, the chocolates and the tea arrive while Cătălina tells me what she does at work. My chocolate is with mango, Cătălina’s with mint. In addition we also ordered a red chai, from rooibos. All of them are excellent although I can't help but think that we could have been at a colorful and funky restaurant instead of a teahouse.

{{< figure src="catalina-interview-7.jpg" >}}

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„I'm very lucky," Cătălina tells me, "because I really like what I do. Including helping people. I was the Chief Happiness Officer in the agency. Now, in addition to marketing, I do a kind of onboarding, taking new people through an induction program to help them integrate more easily. I just like to take care of people.”</p>
</blockquote>

There, we now have a title for the article. I put the work aside for a moment and ask Cătălina about the subject of the evening: Bruno, her dog, possibly the smallest dog I have ever seen. Bruno is a Yorkshire Terrier and I have two cats bigger than him at home. I tell this to Cătălina and she tells me Bruno's epic tale.

{{< figure src="catalina-interview-8.jpg" >}}

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„In high school I wanted a puppy, as I told you. In college I saw my first Yorkie, on a trip to Vienna, and it was love at first sight. When I was working in the newsroom with Olivia and Cătălin, my friends all chipped in and got me a Yorkie pup, Bruno. He was effectively the size of a small cup, I would bring him to the newsroom in my purse and people would take care of him. Now I can't see life without him.”</p>
</blockquote>

Cătălina has always wanted to volunteer at an animal center, but she simply can't, so she donates money to them. When she doesn't spend time with Bruno or Code for Romania, she takes care of Social Media for SkirtBike, the bike community around the annual bicycle parade.

{{< figure src="catalina-interview-9.jpg" >}}

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„I participated in the parade in 2012 and won the competition for the cutest cyclist. The prize was a bike I named Ariel, because it's turquoise, and I still have it.”</p>
</blockquote>

{{< figure src="catalina-interview-10.jpg" >}}

Cătălina has formed a close friendship with 20 cyclists, the hard core of SkirtBike, and is part of the community communication team. As a cyclist, she, like us all, suffers from the lack of bicycle lanes. Since IBM moved its headquarters, she can't go to work with Ariel anymore because it's too dangerous. Instead, she started taking courses of swing, Lindy Hop, which she has been practicing for almost ten months.

{{< figure src="catalina-interview-11.jpg" >}}

Cătălina arrived in Code for Romania almost from the first day, after she was invited by Olivia to meet Bogdan at Zeppelin Pub, the official Code for bar.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„I really liked the project and I instantly wanted to get involved, although I'm quite the opposite of technical, and the project was tech. But I wanted to help because I saw how excited Olivia, who was always a role model for me, was. It was, therefore, a hope that maybe we can do something that, little by little, could change everything.”</p>

    <p class="is-italic">„People keep asking me if I want to leave the country. My best friends and many other friends left. And I would have left, but I feel somehow connected to Romania, I couldn't leave. Code for Romania was the thing that made me confident again that we can change something for the better, here.”</p>

</blockquote>

{{< figure src="catalina-interview-12.jpg" >}}

Like me, Cătălina didn't know what Civic Tech was about before she entered the field. But she quickly caught everything on the fly, and became one of the core members of our team. I ask her what she thinks we could do to improve Code.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„Sometimes, when you volunteer, everything can be a bit distant and challenging, people work when they can, from where they can. I would like more face to face interaction, more working together. The way we work now is also very ok for me. We can all contribute as much as we can and I have never felt overwhelmed.”</p>
</blockquote>

Concluding, I ask Cătălina what she likes most about Code for Romania.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„What I like most about us are the people and their dedication, I can't believe how dedicated some volunteers are, how involved they are, how they sacrifice their nights, and I think that motivates me more than anything else. We are like a puzzle in which the pieces blend perfectly. That, I think, holds us together, the fact that we have a common goal that we believe in and work on little by little. And I haven't seen that in any company.”</p>
</blockquote>

We pay the bill and descend so I can take some pictures for the article. On the way, Cătălina Coca tells me one last anecdote.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„You know, on Monday when I came to the office after the weekend with the referendum, when I stayed in the call center for three days, my colleagues congratulated me as if I had won the elections. This is fantastic, because the world knows about us and supports us.”</p>
</blockquote>

We leave for home through the torrential rain. When you read this article, it was probably posted by Cătălina. Thank her in the comments.
