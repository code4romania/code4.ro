The state taxes with 16% any profit that the company registers, but <span class="has-background-warning">you can give up to 20% of this amount to Code for Romania in the form of a sponsorship.</span>. This means that you have the opportunity to support the development of digital tools useful in solving Romania's most pressing problems.

Your money will be used to update Romania, namely to <span class="has-background-warning">develop and maintain the civic technology infrastructure that Romania needs</span>. **MonitorizareVot**, **Redirectioneaza.ro** or **VotDiaspora** are just a few of the pieces that make up this infrastructure that you would be able to support every month.

**The procedure itself is simple and has only a few steps:**:

1. Complete a sponsorship contract that you can [consult here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTJgAn5HG9yNcuTOJYBmzkN9c-eLmvauT8TQAfn9Yl9VXnEyzXSdlNof3bmsCksw_-cIKVUXgbceFaR/pub);

   _The company will have to make, at the time of drafting the contract, an estimate of the value of the share of 20% of the profit tax for the current year. The contract thus concluded is the proof of the sponsorship act, and based on it the redirection will be performed. Sponsorship operations through cash or bank transfer will be reflected in the accounting and will be highlighted separately._

2. you send me the contract with the company data and the amount of sponsorship in editable format at the email address oana.despan(at)code4.ro;;

3. I print, sign and stamp the two copies and send them to the mailing address indicated by you;

   _This document will be the basis for redirecting the 20% of the profit of the company you represent._

4. you return our copy of the contract signed and stamped by you and we thank you monthly, for at least one year :)

**If you want the sponsorship to be taken into account in your fiscal calculations for 2019** <span class="has-background-warning">do not forget to pay the sponsorship contract with Code for Romania until December 31, 2019</span>; if payment is made after December 31, it will be considered sponsorship for 2020.

**How do you calculate the amount with which you can sponsor Code for Romania projects?**

- Estimate the profit for the fiscal year 2019 as well as the turnover for this year for your company;
- he sponsorship amount, if it falls within the limits provided in the Fiscal Code (20% of the profit tax, maximum 3 ‰ (per thousand) of the turnover), is deducted from the tax;
- the difference left over from the tax due will be turned over to the state budget, within the deadline stipulated by the law (January 25, 2019).

<span class="has-background-warning">**If the company did not make a profit this year**</span> but you are sure that 2019 was an exception, you can deduct the sponsorship made to us quarterly, as the financial situation of your company becomes a positive one.

_NOTE:_

_Law no. 227/2015 allows companies paying corporate tax to redirect 20% of the amount due annually to the state budget to non-governmental organizations. The sponsorship is deductible from the profit tax, if it falls within the limits imposed by the Fiscal Code (3 ‰ of the Turnover and 20% of the tax). Sponsorship can also be done quarterly and is deducted from its profit tax, if the payment of the sponsored amount is made during that quarter._
