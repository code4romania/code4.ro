At the end of the day, on Friday, we were thinking that the only thing we can do is to close the [Vot Diaspora](https://votdiaspora.ro/#/home) platform despite our desire to continue to help the citizens of the diaspora on every election round. You have kept the project live for the <span class="has-background-success">102.989 de oameni</span> people who have searched for the nearest polling station or the list of necessary documents for the vote. Thank you.

{{< figure src="google_bill.png" caption="(left) The bill for the Vot Diaspora, for the European Parliament elections. (right) Bill for Vot Diaspora after the 1st round of presidential elections." >}}

Voting Diaspora generated costs of **\$5473.89** this year and we expect a cost of over $3,000 for the second round of presidential elections alone. Your donations, from **233 donors**, covered **$4206.18\*\* of this cost. Also as a result of your mobilization, we received a message from Google on Saturday who wants to give us some free credits for the Vot Diaspora project, although similar requests from us have not been successful in the past. We are waiting for confirmation now and we hope that as much of the money gap as possible for the second round of elections will be covered by these credits.

<span class="has-background-success">We thank those who set up a recurring donation.</span> We will use donations in the coming months to maintain and develop the ecosystem of applications that make Romania's elections freer and fairer.

[Monitorizare Vot](https://votemonitor.org) is already being used for the fifth time on elections and is helping independent observers transmit real-time data on what's happening in polling stations. With the help of this app we reduced the reporting period on the status of elections from six months to one day.

Starting this election round, we also launched [Rezultate Vot](http://www.rezultatevot.ro/web), a platform that presents in a simple and intuitive way real-time data on elections: attendance, election monitoring and voting results. We will continue to add historical voting data in Romania as well as polls to this platform.

We are developing a platform that digitizes the wealth statements of all elected politicians over the last 15 years and some other products that we hope will come to fruition for the next two election cycles.

This whole ecosystem is built with entirely pro-bono efforts, not being supported by anyone other than you through your donations and the work of the Code for Romania volunteers.

**We are the ones we have been waiting for. Nobody else is coming.**
