Andrei Onel is one of the golden boys of Code for Romania. A volunteer for several years now, a member of the association since last year, Andrei has designed and delivered for Code for Romania one of the most useful projects for the whole civil society, [Redirecționează.ro](https://redirectioneaza.ro/). Andrei is the kind of man who can’t stand still, who speaks only as much as he needs to and who, when speaking, says quickly and concisely what he has to say. I am the exact opposite, I talk a lot and I often jump from one topic to the next until the train of thoughts completely derails for me and the interlocutor. It's going to be an interesting interview.

I met Andrei in front of the Code for Romania headquarters where he came to pick me up by car. Surprisingly warm outside for October, Andrei chose a terrace restaurant for our lunch discussion, namely [Energiea](https://energiea.ro/), the hipster mecca in that area that is technically-in-old-downtown-but-still-tolerable. Navigating noon traffic, Andrei tells me about his daily schedule.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„I work with Americans, from about 4 in the afternoon until midnight. This has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that I have free mornings, that’s when I am fresh, I can work on what I want to, the disadvantage is that I can hardly reach any social gatherings in the evening, such as the Code for meetups.”</p>
</blockquote>

Andrei is a native of Braila, so I ask him what brought him to Bucharest. He tells me that Braila is an OK city, but that there’s a big chance it will eventually empty, because everyone is going either to Bucharest or Abroad. Andrei also left to study Cybernetics in Bucharest. During college he also joined [Junior Achievement](https://www.facebook.com/JuniorAchievementRO/), where he did some volunteering.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„I liked the atmosphere from Junior Achievement so I started working there part time between 2011 and 2013.”</p>
</blockquote>

Andrei has always been a man who wants to do many new things so during his time at Junior Achievement, besides work and college he also started [Edumo](https://www.edumo.org/), a free tutoring platform for mathematics for high school students. Everything he recorded, Andrei shared for free online for students. After Junior Achievement, Andrei reserved three full months in which all he did was to deal with Edumo, sustaining himself from savings.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„I liked this part of education so I took a job on Python and the technologies I liked, a job for a client in education, a Boston startup that helps teachers do real-time quizzes for students in the classroom.  Students responded in real time. We were a team of 4, two Americans in Boston and two Romanians in Bucharest and it was a startup atmosphere. Besides, it was in education, which interested me.”</p>
</blockquote>

Arriving at Energiea we go on fiscal responsibility and we both order the menu of the day, a menu consisting of celery cream soup, some Italian bruschetta and Asian chicken with rice. Food from Energiea tries hard to be innovative all the time and often succeeds. But at the same time it has some nostalgic quality of "home made" that goes well for a lunch. The drinks are a different story. Everything from the sour cherry puree in my sour cherry and lavender lemonade to the lemons, juniper and syrups used at the bar, Energiea finds combinations that you swear you wouldn’t like but that go surprisingly well. We choose to stay inside although it is nice outside, because the sun and the menu of the day have attracted a wide range of noisy customers. Inside it is less crowded and the atmosphere is more chill for our discussion.

As Edumo started to grow, Andrei decided to focus full time on the project. For a year and a half, Andrei “rode the bench” and took care of Edumo, monetizing an otherwise free site through online tutoring. He received very good feedback and continued with the platform, turning it into a kind of mini-startup.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„It's a kind of community service, I did Edumo because it was needed. We didn't have something similar in Romania and, because I liked the idea of ​​Khan Academy, I decided to make content on that model - simple content, with students focused on what is being taught.”</p>
</blockquote>

Also at Code Andrei he sees his work as a kind of community service. "It's a better defined field for Americans – to volunteer as community service. That's why we also need that and this is what Code for Romania is doing. An effort to help Romania, to support civility and democracy ... but while doing something I like, namely Tech."

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„While working at Edumo I found Josh, an American from Salt Lake City who has a podcasting startup.”</p>
</blockquote>

Podcasting being fashionable and using a number of technologies that Andrei was interested in (Web RTC) Andrei was enthusiastic about the project. Andrei focused more and more on the American project, starting part time and, for a year and a half, working full time on it. Andrei still works with Edumo for several hours a week, in addition to his work with Code and a new secret start-up project.

Andrei is a serial entrepreneur in the civic start-up scene. Also working part-time, he developed the precursor of the receipt lottery, an idea then taken over by the Government through the Romanian Lottery. But more important for all of us, Andrei has developed, also working part-time, donezșieu, the precursor of the [Redirecționează.ro](https://redirectioneaza.ro/) project.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„I had finished the campaign with the receipts and I really had nothing to do, I had an empty space in my life. And I knew about the 2% forms from Junior Achievement, why the NGOs need money.”</p>
</blockquote>

Andrei launched Donezșieu and contacted various NGOs to register. He saw the platform slowly grow. But it was a lot of hard work and he was also busy with the job and Edumo.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„I was looking for an NGO that could take over the project because I wasn't doing well. I talked to Ryan from The Good Bureau to pick it up but they had some issues and they put me in contact with Code. In January 2017 I spoke with Code for Romania. I wrote – hello, I have this project, it has some traffic, but I don't have time to manage it. Do you want it?”</p>
</blockquote>

Andrei spoke to Olivia, introduced her to the project and thought he was off the hook. But he saw that some bugfixes, a deployment solution, were still needed and he stayed on the project.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„I really liked the atmosphere at Code, a combination of the atmosphere of a start-up and the NGOs, strong people. Then came the redesign of July 2017 and the relaunch and I was already in too deep to escape", Andrei says laughing.</p>
</blockquote>

Does he regret?

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„No, of course not, if I didn't like it, I would have retired and be done with that. The initial idea was to give you the project and leave. But I liked the people, the projects, the atmosphere. Now I spend 95% of my time on Redirecționează, on a full time job and on my next project.”</p>
</blockquote>

[Redirecționează.ro](https://redirectioneaza.ro/) is a project worthy of the attention of Andrei and the volunteers who contributed to it. One of the most useful projects for [Code for Romania](https://civiclabs.ro/ro/solutions), Redirecționează makes filling in the 2% forms and choosing the recipients easier for everyone, from donors to NGOs. With over 1,000 NGOs registered on the platform in 2019, and a few thousand forms submitted, the project started by Andrei has taken on a life of its own. This is why, this year, he was rewarded with the first prize in the category Civic behavior and public participation at the Civil Society Gala, the third trophy in three years obtained by Code for Romania. Andrei was there, on stage to receive the prize, the first among equals along with several members of Code for Romania.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">"I’m restless" concludes Andrei Onel laughing as we try hard to get the check at the busiest time of lunch.</p>
</blockquote>

Indeed, Andrei is restless. One of the most dedicated and active volunteers and members of Code for Romania cannot stop working. I ask him what plans he has for the future.

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">"I have a project that I hope to turn into a start-up, I have my job which is in the field of podcasts, which are growing now. And of course, of course, volunteering. For now I hope to stay in Romania."</p>
</blockquote>

Talking about Romania, I ask Andrei what he thinks Code for Romania should do better. He tells me that, at the moment, with a team of volunteers of over a thousand people, more communication efforts must be made, both internally and externally. That's why we're here, right? I tell him, but Andrei continues

<blockquote>
	<p class="is-italic">„I only worked with one other volunteer on Redirecționează but I feel that there are serious resources among our volunteers, and we have to reach them, to enthuse people. We need to let them know that we are here and that we need them, every day, not just at HackDays.”</p>
</blockquote>

And after all that's why we're here, and that's why we talk to Andrei Onel, the restless man who delivered almost by himself one of Code's most successful projects. Because we have a big community, a cool community, full of interesting people, with the know-how to change this country. Andrei Onel is unique but he is not alone in the community and every person, regardless of skillset, can do something fantastic for Code, but especially for the society around us. [If you want to help us](https://code4.ro/ro/implica-te/), we always have something to do. For Romania.
