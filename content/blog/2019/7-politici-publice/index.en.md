There have been four long days at Code for Romania so it is appropriate to start with thanks to all the volunteers and friends who answered our call, although we are in the middle of the weekend, at which point we started work on “[7 public policies for the effective digitization of Romania](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSflLxT-xW6g0gV-DQF0f3Hhuf-zAC-TaanWBng3QIrAGUZspQ/viewform)”.

The chronology of the events that led to an 18-page document is as follows: Friday afternoon we received the invitation from Prime Minister Ludovic Orban to participate to the civil society consultation, for Monday, October 21 at 14:00 for one hour. We knew that he had 10 days available for choosing the cabinet of ministers, for which the countdown had already started on Tuesday, so we understood the rush with which this request was made. No later than noon on Saturday, you received an email from me asking for your opinion on this subject. By noon Sunday, I already had 35 ideas from you, all relevant and well-argued. Thank you for all the effort, but especially for the interest given to the subject. Sunday evening, after midnight, together with a few colleagues from Code for Romania, we were finalizing the document, after which today, early in the morning we formatted and printed it in order to hand it to the political factors present at the meeting.

All the 7 proposals that make up the document are based on the researches from [Civic Labs](https://civiclabs.ro), the experience of the members of the organization as well as the one gained after collaborating with the state authorities on various projects during the last three years of Code for Romania. Please read the [document](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSflLxT-xW6g0gV-DQF0f3Hhuf-zAC-TaanWBng3QIrAGUZspQ/viewform) and then please share it on your social networks so that as many people as possible understand the urgent need we are facing, the efficient digitization of Romania.
It is structured as follows:

- Status of Code for Romania collaborations with public institutions;
- The IT products and the Code for Romania knowledge that we offers pro bono to any government on day two;
- The ecosystem of the seven strategic proposals meant to create the conditions of a correct digitization process in Romania.
