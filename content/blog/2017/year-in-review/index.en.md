title: "2017 — Year in Review: Faster than the speed of light"
excerpt: "It’s been a long journey, filled with ups and downs, challenges, successes and a lot of hard work. We grew faster than the speed of light and now we are a community of over 500 volunteers, working on 20+ projects. We incubated many great ideas and we are now slowly turning them all into reality with the help of our amazing teams."

All throughout 2017 we struggled and succeeded in finding the best way to deliver projects and we have optimized a project flow suitable for civic tech volunteer work that happens simultaneously across the entire globe. We got organized in departments, we are working on our own volunteer management platform and we have managed to finalize a manual meant to help any new person to jump on a project in no time and find his way around. We listened and talked a lot and we continuously polished our procedures and practices in order to keep everyone efficient and happy.

We have proudly put Romania on the map of civic technology in this world and 2018 will be the year when the world will be meeting us in Bucharest, for the Code for All summit.

We are now ready to rock!

Here is a short presentation of what 2017 looked like and a sneak preview on just [a few of the plans we have for the near future][1].
