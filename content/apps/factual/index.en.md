Factual.ro, developed by Funky Citizens, is the first fact-checking website in Romania. The Code for Romania Team is developing the 2.0 version of this platform. The effort is focused in two directions: enhancing usersâ€™ experience and creating interactive mechanisms to streamline the fact-checking process and the communications between specialists.
