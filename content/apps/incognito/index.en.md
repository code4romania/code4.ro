The lack of a secure communication channel that could grant anonymity to everyone who wants to send sensitive information to the media, discouraged whistleblowing in Romania, making people reluctant to reporting on crimes and corruption they witness.

Incognito is a platform that acts as a secure e-mail box between you and the media outlet or NGO you wish to send information to. Nobody, unless you decide otherwise, may track you down via the platform. You are the only person holding the communication key between you and the journalist or NGO and they may contact you only if you decide you want to continue the conversation.

We hope that by making this instrument available, more people, who are not tech-savvy enough to use complex encryption methods will now report on crime. We encourage and enable journalists and NGOs to protect their sources by using the platform.
