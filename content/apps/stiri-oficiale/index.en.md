**Objective**: Combating disinformation.

**How**:

1. Platform which centralizes all the official press releases, press conferences and decisions of the Committee for Special Emergency Situations.
2. Browser add-on which identifies in any web page key phrases and adds over them an info box which redirects towards official information sources.

*Concept developed as part of the Civic Labs program of Code for Romania*
