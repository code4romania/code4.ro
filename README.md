## Getting Started

First, you must have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) installed on your system.

1. `git clone https://github.com/code4romania/code4.ro` to clone this repository
2. `cd code4.ro`
3. `npm install` to install dependencies
4. `npm run dev` to build the frontend (using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org))
5. `hugo serve` to start a local server
   - This automatically runs `hugo` (with no arguments) behind the scenes, wihch builds the website and puts all the files in a directory called _public_. This directory is then statically served.
   - If your URL is any other than _localhost_ (e.g. you're serving the website form a cloud machine), you must use the `--baseURL [your url here]`. This is because the website uses absolute paths in hyperlinks, and it must know the URL from which it is served.

## How It Works

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is a static website engine. This means we write source files, which are used to generate HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, which we then serve statically. There is no backend involved whatsoever.
